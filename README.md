# Satellite Mosaics
Satellites provide incredible perspectives of Earth. A view without borders displaying the power of Mother Nature. This repository provides tools for making beautiful satellite images.

Publically-funded satellites (thanks NASA) are constantly taking pictures of Earth from space. These pictures are released daily, and adhere to a specific grid system. Whenever the salellite takes a picture of Seattle, the frame of the photo always stretches from Rainier to Vancouver island.

Processing these images is difficult - the file sizes are huge, clouds obstruct land, and lighting conditions vary from frame to frame. Satellite Mosaics provides a suite of tools for working with satellite imagery:
- A website for searching and processing satellite images
- A auto-scalable pipeline built in AWS for processing these images
- Cloud-based storage of satellite files
